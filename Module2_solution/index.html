      <section id="p1"><span>Cricket</span></section>
      <p>Cricket is played between two teams of 11 members each, it is on a flat, smooth and clean ground. Cricket requires two sets of stumps, wickets and a ball. The distance between two sets of wickets is 22 yards. The bowlers take their turns after every six balls. In this fielding is also necessary for victory. Before the game starts, there is the toss. It is the whim of the toss-winning captain to first go for batting or fielding. The fielding party puts three fieldsmen on the one side, six on the off side, while one is posted for guarding the wicket and one for the bowling. The game is generally played for six hours a day. The umpire is the final judge. He is the man who declares the players ?out?; whether they are run out, bowled out, caught out, stumped out or leg-before-wicket out.

      <p>Rugby union, widely known simply as rugby, is a full contact team sport that originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.
